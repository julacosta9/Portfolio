				<p>Experienced technology project management professional with demonstrated success in executing complex projects in support of client’s growth goals. Consistent top-performer with strong leadership capabilities and outstanding analytical, communication, and problem-solving skills. I have managed integrated,cross-channel projects under both waterfall and agile methodologies.</p>
				<p>Outside of professional work, I enjoy producing music. I've been producing music for about 10 years and use Ableton Live as my software. Music production has also introduced me to synthesis and sound design, which I love experimenting with and learning about. I hope to utilize my programming skills to work on some side projects related to synthesis.</p>
				<p>I also enjoy computers (ask me about my PC I built &#128515), following tech & gadget news, gaming, and movies.</p>
